# Mining Platform Landing Page Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern fintech and crypto platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and mining platforms, combined with cyberpunk/futuristic gaming aesthetics for the neon-lit visual treatment.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Dark Theme Foundation:**
- Background: 220 15% 8% (deep dark blue-gray)
- Surface: 220 12% 12% (slightly lighter surface)

- RZ Green: 142 70% 55% (matching logo green)
- RZ Accent: 142 60% 65% (brighter green for highlights)

**Neon Effects:**
Use CSS box-shadow and text-shadow with the theme colors for glowing effects on cards, buttons, and key elements.

### Typography

- **Headers**: Bold weights (700-900) with letter-spacing for tech aesthetic
- **Body**: Regular/Medium (400-500) for readability
- **Accents**: Mono fonts for hash rates and technical data

### Layout System
**Spacing Units**: Use Tailwind units of 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 for consistent rhythm
- Small gaps: p-4, m-6
- Medium spacing: p-8, m-12
- Large sections: p-16, m-20
